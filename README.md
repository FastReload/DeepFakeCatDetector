# DeepFake Cat Detector 🐱🔍  

This repository contains the DeepFake Cat Detector, a project for detecting deepfake cat images using deep learning techniques. The work is part of **CS224 Homework 2** and explores machine learning approaches to distinguish real cat images from AI-generated fakes.

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build a model capable of detecting deepfake cat images using a dataset of real and synthetic cat images. The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and evaluated based on classification accuracy.
